# Simple 2D Physics Engine with OpenGL

This project is a simple 2D physics engine implemented in C++ using OpenGL for rendering. The goal of this project is to explore the basics of 2D physics simulation and rendering using OpenGL.

## Features

- **Rigid Body Dynamics**: Simulate the motion of rigid bodies in a 2D environment.
- **Collision Detection**: Detect collisions between rigid bodies and respond accordingly.
- **Rendering with OpenGL**: Visualize the simulated physics using OpenGL for rendering.

## Dependencies

- **OpenGL**: Used for rendering the simulated physics in a 2D environment.
- **GLFW**: A multi-platform library for OpenGL, used for window and context creation.
- **GLM**: A mathematics library for graphics applications, used for vector and matrix operations.
- *(Any other dependencies you might have)*

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/simple-2d-physics-opengl.git
